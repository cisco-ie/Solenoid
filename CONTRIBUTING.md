## Bug Reports

For bug reports or requests [submit an issue](https://cto-github.cisco.com/lisroach/Solenoid/issues).

## Pull Requests

The preferred way to contribute is to fork the
[main repository](https://cto-github.cisco.com/lisroach/Solenoid) on GitHub.

1. Fork the [main repository](https://cto-github.cisco.com/lisroach/Solenoid).  Click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page.  This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

        $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/solenoid.git
        $ cd solenoid

3. Create a branch to hold your changes and start making changes. Don't work in the `master` branch! If you are adding a feature, use the format 'feature/my-feature', for a bug use 'bug/issue-id'.

        $ git checkout -b feature/my-feature

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control. When you're done editing, run the following to record your changes in Git:

        $ git add modified_files
        $ git commit

5. Push your changes to GitHub with:

        $ git push -u origin my-feature

6. Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the `solenoid` repo and click 'Pull Request' to send your changes for review.
