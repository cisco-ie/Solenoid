# Solenoid
### Route Injection Agent

## Description:

The end goal of this Route injector app is to be able to take any given logic and
make changes to the prefixes on a RIB table.

The changes to the RIB are accomplished by using RESTconf calls to send JSON modeled by YANG. The YANG model I am currently using is [Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-static-cfg] (https://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/master/vendor/cisco/xr/600/Cisco-IOS-XR-ip-static-cfg.yang). This model will likely change in the future, see Limitations.

For reading BGP changes I am using [exaBGP] (https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp). Exabgp allows me to monitor BGP network announcements, withdrawals, etc. and trigger the RESTconf changes based on these updates. exaBGP acts completely as a listener, if you with to send BGP updates directly to Solenoid that should work as well (examples and documentation coming soon)


#### Current Limitations:

As of now, the IOS-XR 6.0 device I am using does not have completed YANG models
for BGP RIB changes. As a temporary workaround, I can only add static routes
to the RIB.


RESTconf is not available on public images of the IOS-XR 6.X. If you are interested in testing RESTconf, please reach out to your Cisco account team or contact me directly.


### Usage:

Step 1: Clone this repo and cd into Solenoid.

Step 2: It is highly recommended you install and use a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```
pip install virtualenv

virtualenv venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

Step 3: Install gRPC (if you are using gRPC).

`pip install grpcio`

Step 4: Install Solenoid.

```python setup.py install```

Step 5 : Create a solenoid.config file in your top-level solenoid directory and fill in the values in the key:value pair. Please refer to the Config File section of the wiki for more information.

```
[default]
transport: transport  # Either gRPC or RESTconf
ip: ip_address        # IP address of the destination RIB table
port: port number     # Depends on what is configured for your gRPC or RESTconf servers
username: username    # Username for the router
password: password    # Password for the router
```

Step 6 (optional): Create a filter.txt file to include the ranges of prefixes to be filtered with. Single prefixes are also acceptable. Example:

```
1.1.1.0/32-1.1.2.0/32
10.1.1.0/32-10.1.5.0/32
10.1.1.6/32
192.168.1.0/28-192.168.2.0/28
```

Step 7: Set up [exaBGP] (https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp). Form a neighborship with your BGP network.

Step 8: Make sure RESTconf calls are working from your device to the RIB table

Example test (you should receive your device's whole configuration):

```
curl -X GET -H "Accept:application/yang.data+json,application/yang.errors+json" --user username:password http://<YOUR IP>/restconf/data/?content=config
```

Step 9: Change your exaBGP configuration file to run the edit_rib.py script. The important part is the process monitor-neighbors section, the rest is basic exaBGP configuration.


Example:

```
group test {
        router-id x.x.x.x;

        process monitor-neighbors {
            encoder json;
            receive {
                parsed;
                updates;
                neighbor-changes;
            }
            run /your/python/location /path/to/solenoid/solenoid/edit_rib.py;
        }

        neighbor y.y.y.y {
            local-address x.x.x.x;
            local as ####;
            peer-as ####;
        }

}

```

If you chose to add a filter file, you must add the path to the file in the run call with the file flag -f (be sure to include the quotes):

```
run /your/python/location /path/to//solenoid/solenoid/edit_rib.py -f '/path/to/filter/file';
```

Step 10: Launch your exaBGP instance. You should see the syslog HTTP status codes if it is successful.

###Testing

To unit test the code, run the following command from the Solenoid/ directory:

```
python -m unittest discover solenoid.tests.mock
```

To run integration testing, run the following command from the Solenoid/ directory. **CAUTION This will make changes to your router's RIB table! Do not run this code in a production environment!**

For these tests to run, you must provide a properly formatted solenoid.config file, as described in step 3.

```
python -m unittest discover solenoid.tests.integration
```

If you receive a status of "OK" you are good to go!
